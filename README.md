# Feed Reader

This is a React.js application that allows users to store, list, and read articles from RSS feeds. It includes a simulated login system and a server-side API for managing feed definitions. Below, I'll outline the tools, technologies, and implementation choices used in this project.

## Features

### 1. Login Screen
- The app has a login screen with hardcoded email and password for a simulated login.

1. Email. You can use any email from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
2. Password "test123"

### 2. Main Dashboard
- After a successful login, users are directed to the main dashboard.
- Users can list and manage feed definitions, including adding and deleting feeds.
- Users can also log out from this screen.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- React Router. For handling navigation between different screens.
